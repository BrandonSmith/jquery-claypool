=== Context ===
'''Extends: Claypool.Context'''

The Application Context provides the foundation for a consistent and flexible retrieval of any object that is managed by the Application. In general this allows less reliance on singleton patterns making code more reusable. 

It also allows the IoC container to inject objects into objects using the 'ref://' protocol in configurations.

==== '''constructor''' ====
- Creates a new Application Context.
||=name||=type||=required||=description||
||options 	||Object ||false 	||A json object which is deeply extended by the resulting new Context.||

==== '''put''' ====
- Adds an item to the Application Context
||=name||=type||=required||=description||
||id 	||String ||true 	||A unique identifier across the application scope.||
||object 	||Any 	||true 	        ||The item to be stored in application scope.||

==== '''get''' ====
- Searches the Application Context for an item stored by the given id.
||=name||=type||=required||=description||
||id 	||String ||true 	||A unique key used to identify the object in the application context.||

=== !ContextContributor ===
'''Implements: Claypool.!ContextContributor'''

The !ContextContributor allows other classes to be searched (in order of registration) whenever the Application Context is searched.

==== '''constructor''' ====
- Creates a new !ContextContributor.
||=name||=type||=required||=description||
||options 	||Object ||false 	||A json object which is deeply extended by the resulting new !ContextContributor.||

==== '''registerContext''' ====
- Attaches this class to the Application Context.
||=name||=type||=required||=description||
||id 	||String ||true 	||A unique id identifying this context among contributors.||

=== Aware ===

A class can easy have built in access to the global application context by extending this class.

==== '''constructor''' ====
- Creates a new Application Aware class.
||=name||=type||=required||=description||
||options 	||Object ||false 	||A json object which is deeply extended by the resulting new Aware object.

==== '''getApplicationContext''' ====
- Returns the global Application Context.
