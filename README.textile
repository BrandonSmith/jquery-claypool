h1. Welcome to jQuery-Claypool 

h2. A Web 1.6180339... jQuery Application Framework

jquery-claypool is a small, concise, fast, railable javascript application framework,
built as a jquery-plugin that provides all the usual important patterns for 
large, long-lived client-side apps, server-side apps, or something strangely, 
beautifully in the middle.
          
like django, rails, and spring but built for jquery.  jquery-claypool provides
a powerful routing framework, simple scanners for nearly-zero configuration, highly
optimized category logging, aspect oriented filters, automagically managed inversion 
of control, sinlge point of entry, swappable environments and minimal requirement mvc.  
and if all of those big words don't scare you away, jquery-claypool will make your 
life simpler, cheaper, and most importantly lazier. cheers to lazy.

jquery-claypool is both a client (browser) and server-side framework that fits in
a compressed, gzipped file that is smaller than jquery itself.  we can achieve
this by simply allowing you to use whatever model and view plugins you love the most,
while simultaneously letting you write controllers the same way you would write event
handler without jquery-claypool.  i.e. there is no notion of framework required
extension patterns.  you decide how you like to write and we just wire it up cleanly and 
most importantly, transparently.
