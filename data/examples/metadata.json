			This little app demonstrates all the basics, though in the real
			world, if this all you needed to do you probably wouldn't need,
			or benifit much from jquery-claypool.

            Note that additional link to 'Mini-App'.  This demonstrates that
            jquery-claypool apps can be loaded on top of each other even well
            after an app has been already running, this one waits about ten 
            seconds and simulates the addition of a app that simply logs a 
            statement to the firebug console when the link is clicked.
