            Welcome to jQuery-Claypool!  This is where a Project begins...
            When you use this manual, understand we have two purposes for
            providing information in this "project layout" format.
            We want to share, and we want you to be able to share, and a couple
            simple conventions provide a simple framework for doing just that.
        </p>
        <p>    
            These conventions are not required in general, and by design.
            Feel free to modify conventions as suits your project, and feel
            encouraged to provide your experience and requirements so we can
            integrate painlessly.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will be able to understand any jquery-claypool app by understanding
            where to put and find things.  Nothing new about that idea.  
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href='./configs'>app/configs</a>
                    <p>
                        You will find all the high level wiring for event routing, 
                        logging, environments, and filters.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href='./models'>app/models</a> |
                    <a href='./views'>app/views</a> |
                    <a href='./controllers'>app/controllers</a><br/>
                    <p>
                        The models, views, and controllers folders will hold all your
                        app specific code while seperating concerns to keep it clean
                        and concise.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href='./'>app/boot</a>
                    <p>
                        Whether you are writing a client-side or server-side app,
                        this is the application entry point.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>  
        </p>
