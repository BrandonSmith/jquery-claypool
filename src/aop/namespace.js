 * @projectDescription 	This code is adopted from the jQuery AOP plugin project.  It was incorporated so it
 * 						could be extended and modified to match the overall javascript style of the rest of
 * 						Claypool. Many thanks to it's author(s), as we rely heavily on the code and learned
 * 						a lot from it's integration into Claypool.
